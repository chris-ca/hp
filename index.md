# Hello!
My name is Christian Weyland and I'm an outdoor, cycling and web enthusiast born and raised in Germany. I've lived and worked in Germany, Canada and Switzerland.

As of March 2023 I'm open to job opportunities in Western Europe.

## Professional background
I'm originally a full-stack (LAMP) web developer with a strong liking for devops and a business mindset. After my agency career I've worked in various roles in the travel industry:

- As **online marketing specialist** for the German source market
- As a **key account manager** and technical contact for a multinational team 
- As a **product owner** for website + APIs

## Travel
From 6/2018 to 3/2023 I've been on a self-funded, extensive bicycle trip covering more than 40 countries. My travel website [bumyproad.org](https://bumpyroad.org) has some details including my route and lots of photos.

## Coding
While coding was never a requirement for my latest positions it was extremely helpful to increase productivity for both, my own tasks as well as for colleagues.

While the code I've created at work remains closed source, my [Github repository](https://github.com/chris-ca/) has a few bits on hobby projects I've done.

#### My stack:
- For the server: Any Debian based Linux distro
- For the desktop: Ubuntu
- For fun: Raspbian, of course
- Text editing: tmux + vim
- Web development: PHP with Yii, Craft CMS. Will touch Javascript or SQL if necessary.
- For data processing and shell: Python

## Hobbies and interests
- Cycling/bicycle touring
- Trekking, hiking, camping
- Sports climbing (indoors and outdoors)
- Mapping and contributing to [Openstreetmap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/chris-ca)
- Video editing with kdenlive
- Anything else involving a computer

## Contact
My [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-weyland-5b82ab5) has more details on my professional background and is a good point of contact, but you can also send an email to "chris" @ this domain.
