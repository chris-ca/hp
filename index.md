# Good morning

Please excuse the lack of content. I'm currently cycling the world. My travel website "[bumyproad.org](https://bumpyroad.org)" has all the details including my route and looooots of photos

## Coding + IT
I'm originally a full-stack (LAMP) web developer. In the last decade I've worked in various roles in the travel industry, most recently as website product owner. Due to travels I'm not a very active coder right now, but my [Github repository](https://github.com/chris-ca/) has a few bits.

## Job opportunities
I'm not explicitly looking for jobs at the moment but always open for interesting suggestions (currently planning a 3+ months stay in Taiwan starting around April 2020).

## Contact
My [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-weyland-5b82ab5) has more details on my professional background and is a good poin of contact, but you can also send an email to "chris" @ this domain.
