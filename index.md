# Good morning

Sorry for the lack of content. I'm currently cycling the world. My travel website [bumyproad.org](https://bumpyroad.org) has all the details including my route and looooots of photos

## Coding + IT
I'm originally a full-stack (LAMP) web developer with a liking for Devops. In the last decade I've worked in various roles in the travel industry, most recently as website product owner. Due to travels I'm not a very active coder right now, but my [Github repository](https://github.com/chris-ca/) has a few bits. 

### My stack
- For the server: Any Debian based Linux distro
- For the desktop: Ubuntu
- For fun: Raspbian, of course
- Text editing: tmux + vim
- Web development: PHP with Yii, Craft CMS. Will touch Javascript or SQL only if necessary.
- For data processing and shell: Python

## Job opportunities
I'm not explicitly looking for jobs at the moment but always open for interesting suggestions (worldwide).

## Contact
My [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-weyland-5b82ab5) has more details on my professional background and is a good point of contact, but you can also send an email to "chris" @ this domain.
