My name is Christian ("Chris") Weyland and I'm an outdoor, cycling and web enthusiast born and raised in Germany. I've lived and worked in Germany, Canada and Switzerland.

I speak fluent _German_, _English_, a decent bit of _Français_ and I can understand (though not speak) some of the _Swiss German_ dialects.

<div class="notice notice--warning"><strong>🇩🇪 Meine Muttersprache ist deutsch</strong>. Meine privaten Webseiten pflege ich aber hauptsächlich auf englisch, da ich mich häufig in internationalen Kontexten bewege. Sprich mich einfach an, wenn du bestimmte Infos auf deutsch benötigst!</div>

## Professional background

I'm originally a full-stack _LAMP web developer_ with a strong liking for devops and a business mindset. After my agency career I've worked in various roles in the travel industry:

- As **online marketing specialist** for the German source market
- As a **key account manager** and technical contact for a multinational team 
- As a **product owner** (SCRUM/PSPO) for website + APIs

## What I'm looking for 

- I excel and enjoy most working in a position as middleman between business and IT, e.g. as a product owner
- I'm most interested to work on products or projects dealing with sustainability, travel, or digitization, but open to investigate other industries
- I'm happy to work in any country in EU, but prefer a position in Germany
- I'm open to both, remote or onsite work

## Travel

In 2018, the travel bug got hold of me. From 6/2018 to 3/2023 embarked on a self-funded, extensive _bicycle tour_ covering more than _40 countries on 3 continents_. My travel website [bumyproad.org](https://bumpyroad.org) has a few stories, including my route and lots of photos.

## Coding

While coding was not a requirement for my later positions I could use it on many occasions and it was extremely helpful to increase productivity for both, my own tasks as well as for my team mates' day-to-day life.

The code I've created at work remains closed source but my [Github repository](https://github.com/chris-ca/) has a few bits on projects I've done in my spare time.
