All good things have to come to an end at some point. This journey is no exception!

When I set out in mid 2018 with a vague goal of a _bicycle world tour_ in mind, I never expected it to last almost 5 years, and I never imagined to cycle almost 40.000 km.

Of course, I had certain ideas. But they were never cast in stone. Only one thing, I swore to myself: 5 years will be the end of it.

> And here we are. Almost 5 years later, I’m ready to start a new chapter in that book called “Life”.

Let’s see what’s written next.
